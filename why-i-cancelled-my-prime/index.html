<meta name="description" content="We all know the Amazon marketplace and its features. It’s a fantastic machine for selling products online, probably the best in the world.

One-click shopping, wish lists, save for later, the infinite selection of products and vendors, the best prices for most products, etc. With Prime you get all of this, plus free shipping on almost every item.

This is partially the reason why I cancelled my Prime subscription and why I’m not buying anymore from Amazon.

By not buying anymore from them, I buy a lot less stuff that I don’t really need.

Then, I’m trying to buy less from online sources. Buying online is great and convenient, but it’s not really good for the planet to have all these small packets shipped in all directions. It’s also not good for the local shops.

Another reason is the dominant position of Amazon over online shopping. Having such a big player killing all the competition is never good in the long run for consumers. There are already a lot of products that are difficult to find outside of Amazon.

Finally there’s the appalling lack of social responsibility of the company. From under-paying their employees, treating them like shit in fulfilment centres, uber-izing the delivery process or even organising this ridiculous global auction for HQ2. Why would you want to participate to this? If you want to know what social responsibility is, just look at what Patagonia does.">
