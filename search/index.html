        "title": "Switch Between Apache Kafka and Confluent Versions with Homebrew",
        "author": "Ldom",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Once you’ve installed Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform using Homebrew, there are many ways to maintain multiple versions of the package on your local computer.(This is kinda part 2 of Install and Configure Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform using Homebrew.)To switch from a version to another with Homebrew (here: 5.3.1), simply do:brew switch confluent-platform 5.3.1This is great but it relies on the fact that the version you want to switch to is currently installed locally in your cellar. If it’s the case, Homebrew does the switch instantly by updating symlinks.There are several ways to ensure that you have all the versions that you want in your local computer. At some point, they will collide with the fact that Homebrew does a cleanup every 30 days or each time you run an upgrade, unless you the HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP envvar.You can:      Use HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP when upgrading all Homebrew packages to keep the previous versions on your disk. Unless it is set, brew cleanup will be run for the formula that you’re upgrading or, every 30 days, for all formulae. It will fill your disk quite quickly if you use a lot of packages and unless you’re super careful, you’ll loose your previous versions sooner or later.        Build you own keg and feed it with the versions that you want to keep using brew extract. Too much work IMHO.        Use HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP when upgrading confluent-platform. If the version you want is gone, restore it using brew install referencing the specific commit number. (Also remember to backup the Confluent/Kafka config files in a folder outside of Homebrew.)  In this article, I’m describing Option 3.Reference points:  https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/confluent-platform –&gt; page for the formula in Homebrew  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/confluent-platform.rb –&gt; location of the formula for the Confluent Platform in the repo  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commits/master/Formula/confluent-platform.rb –&gt; commit history of the formulaTo install for the first time, run:brew install confluent-platformTo upgrade without removing the previous versions, run:$ HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1 brew upgrade confluent-platformUpdating Homebrew....../...==&gt; Upgrading 1 outdated package:confluent-platform 5.3.1 -&gt; 5.4.0.../...(To set the option permanently and for all the Homebrew packages, you can add export HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1 to your bash profile but I don’t recommend it.)To check what you have locally (in this example, I have 5.3.1 and 5.4.0):$ brew info confluent-platformIf you want to re-install a previous version:  Get the commit number at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commits/master/Formula/confluent-platform.rb. If it says “this commit history is taking too long to generate”, then clone homebrew-core and check the commits there with git log master -- Formula/confluent-platform.rb.From the above page, you can get the commit numbers of the previous versions. For your convenience, I am listing here some of the recent ones:  5.4.0  ⇢ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/2e229452f5cb591391e6b3f649378ae6d9a1bd1f/Formula/confluent-platform.rb  5.3.1  ⇢ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/1135feef30ba254f692bbeb9afea097b395f3634/Formula/confluent-platform.rb  5.3.0  ⇢ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/6a76b682ff4969afec52cc34be58315cee3271fe/Formula/confluent-platform.rbFor prior versions, it’s a little more complicated as the formula was named confluent-oss before.  Reference the commit number in the install command, for example to install 5.3.0:brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/6a76b682ff4969afec52cc34be58315cee3271fe/Formula/confluent-platform.rbNow, check what you have and go crazy switching versions:brew info confluent-platformOne last thing:  Don’t forget to stop running instances before upgrade/switch operations. (Ctrl-C on your terminals…)  To fully reset your data (delete your topics and log files) between version switches, find where the topics are stored (check the log.dirs config property, by default it’s in /tmp/kafka-logs):rm -rf /tmp/kafka-logsrm -rf /var/log/kafka/*That’s all, folks!",

        "content": "If you’re on a Mac, among the many ways to install Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform, there is Homebrew.The Confluent Platform is available there and installing it is as easy as brew install confluent-platform.Unfortunately, once you’ve run that command, all the Confluent components are installed on your machine but it’s not ready to start and there’s not much documentation to help you.The main advantages with using Homebrew to manage your Confluent packages is that you can have multiple versions of Confluent/Kafka installed and easily switch between them and it uses a lot less resources than Docker.Because of my work, I constantly have to alter my Kafka setup and try new things, so in this article, I’ll focus on starting and configuring things manually.To install, run:brew install confluent-platformOnce this is done, your install is not fully functional. You also have to create the appropriate /var/log folder:sudo mkdir -p /var/log/kafkasudo chown -R $(whoami) /var/log/kafkaThen you’re ready to start a zookeeper and a broker.If you want to modify the configuration first, edit those files:For zookeeper: /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.propertiesFor the broker: /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.propertiesFor connect: /usr/local/etc/kafka/connect-distributed.propertiesNote that /usr/local/etc/kafka points to /usr/local/Cellar/confluent-platform/5.3.1/etc/kafka/ if you’re using 5.3.1.When you’re happy with the config files, open up a bunch of terminal windows and run the various components:First, zookeeper:zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.propertiesThen a broker:kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.propertiesFor a Connect in distributed mode:connect-distributed /usr/local/etc/kafka/connect-distributed.properties`Of course, in addition to the above, all the tools of the platform are installed:$ ls /usr/local/Cellar/confluent-platform/5.3.1/bin/confluent-hub\t\t\t\tkafka-api-start\t\t\t\tkafka-mqtt-run-class\t\t\tkafka-streams-application-reset\t\tschema-registry-startconfluent-rebalancer\t\t\tkafka-avro-console-consumer\t\tkafka-mqtt-start\t\t\tkafka-topics\t\t\t\tschema-registry-stopconnect-distributed\t\t\tkafka-avro-console-producer\t\tkafka-mqtt-stop\t\t\t\tkafka-verifiable-consumer\t\tschema-registry-stop-serviceconnect-standalone\t\t\tkafka-broker-api-versions\t\tkafka-preferred-replica-election\tkafka-verifiable-producer\t\tsecurity-plugins-run-classcontrol-center-3_0_0-reset\t\tkafka-configs\t\t\t\tkafka-producer-perf-test\t\tksql\t\t\t\t\tsr-acl-clicontrol-center-3_0_1-reset\t\tkafka-console-consumer\t\t\tkafka-reassign-partitions\t\tksql-datagen\t\t\t\tstub-api-run-classcontrol-center-console-consumer\t\tkafka-console-producer\t\t\tkafka-replica-verification\t\tksql-print-metrics\t\t\tstub-api-startcontrol-center-export\t\t\tkafka-consumer-groups\t\t\tkafka-rest-run-class\t\t\tksql-run-class\t\t\t\tsupport-metrics-bundlecontrol-center-reset\t\t\tkafka-consumer-perf-test\t\tkafka-rest-start\t\t\tksql-server-start\t\t\tzookeeper-security-migrationcontrol-center-run-class\t\tkafka-delegation-tokens\t\t\tkafka-rest-stop\t\t\t\tksql-server-stop\t\t\tzookeeper-server-startcontrol-center-set-acls\t\t\tkafka-delete-records\t\t\tkafka-rest-stop-service\t\t\tksql-stop\t\t\t\tzookeeper-server-stopcontrol-center-start\t\t\tkafka-dump-log\t\t\t\tkafka-run-class\t\t\t\tksql-test-runner\t\t\tzookeeper-shellcontrol-center-stop\t\t\tkafka-log-dirs\t\t\t\tkafka-server-start\t\t\treplicatorkafka-acls\t\t\t\tkafka-mirror-maker\t\t\tkafka-server-stop\t\t\tschema-registry-run-classYou can use them locally, for example:$ kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list__confluent.support.metrics__consumer_offsetsconnect-configsconnect-offsetsconnect-statusfile_sourcelaurent~ $ kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic laurent&gt;one more line&gt;$If you want more than one zookeeper and one broker (which is enough for many local development tasks or configuration tests), you have to duplicate the configuration files, alter them (at least, add a broker-id into the broker config and point the brokers to separate log.dirs folders) and run the above commands into additional terminal windows pointing to separate config files.And, yes, you’ll end up with many terminal windows, but who cares.",

        "content": "Musing on the Wikipedia, I came across this page.Carl von Ossietzky (1889 — 1938) was a German journalist and pacifist that exposed the clandestine German re-armament between WW1 and 2 and was convicted of espionage in 1931 for it.He received the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize and died of tuberculosis while imprisoned.I’m not going to paraphrase the wiki article here, you should read it. There’s a few things that I find eye-opening in the troubled era that we live in. If History does not repeat itself, at least modern corrupted powers find a lot of inspiration in their models from the past.Was he the first whislteblower? Certainly not, but this is one more stone in the garden of those who said (or keep saying) “we didn’t know”.Another fact is that he wasn’t an extremist. He wrote for a journal that rejected Communism, but found the Social Democrat too compromised. Are whislteblowers extremists? I don’t think so.Being released after a first stay in prison, he didn’t back out and wrote: “…/…German and Jewish are not fixed categories established once and for all in some mystic prehistoric age, but rather flexible concepts which change their content with spiritual and economic changes dependent on the general dynamics of history.”He finally added: “Today there is a strong smell of blood in the air. Literary anti-Semitism forges the moral weapon for murder. Sturdy and honest lads will take care of the rest”. A visionary description of how a general cultural/societal atmosphere helps set the tone for more radical actions.After Hilter got to power, he continued to speak out against the nazis and ended up arrested under “protective custody”.The “protective custody” has always been a convenient concept for abusing power. To protect them from a danger you helped created, you put your opponents in prison. It’s like jailing black people because they could be hurt by white nationalists. (Let’s not give ideas to the fake president.)When Ossietzky was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1935, Hermann Göring strongly suggested he declines the prize, saying that accepting it would mean excluding himself from the German people. Another early version of the ubiquitous but very tired: “if you’re against me, you’re anti-patriotic”.At last, what is sad is that Germany’s Federal Court of Justice didn’t clear his conviction in 1992, applying the law as it stood in 1931. At least he got a memorial statue in Pankow. I’ll try to bring flowers there next time I’m in Berlin.",

        "content": "OK, maybe not so secret, and maybe not so original, but here’s the breakdown.trail mixFor 800g of mix (4 days at 200g per day)  Dried banana: 100g &gt; 300 cal  Raisin: 200g &gt; 600 cal  Pumpkin seeds: 50g &gt; 310 cal  Cajou nut: 100g &gt; 630 cal  Dates: 150g &gt; 525 cal  Almonds: 80g &gt; 530 cal  Peanuts (unsalted): 120g &gt; 770 calTotal calories: 3,665 calories (approx. 460 cal/100g)Notes:  Peanuts have the best calories/weight ratio but I get bored of them pretty quickly so I don’t put that much in this mix.  Fruits are great but they roughly have half the calories per weight as nuts.  On multi-day hikes, I take 200g per day of this mix, plus 2 snack bars for each day (small Snickers bars, Cliff, Kind or Kind Fruit bars).other mealsWhile we’re talking about trail food, here is what I take for the other meals:  For breakfast, I mix 50g of oatmeal with 35g of hot chocolate powder and 60g of muesli. I soak it in water for 1/2hr and that gives me 540 calories for a weight of 145g.  For lunch and diner, I used to have couscous (cold soaked) and 2 small dry sausages for 520 calories and 140g or cold soaked mashed potatoes and 2 slices of dried bacon for 620 cal and 185g. Now that I’m vegetarian, I’m going to have to find something to replace the sausages and bacon.In total, it is around 2,500 cal and 700g per day of food (not counting the few snack bars).As I quickly get bored with eating the same thing every day, I tend to eat less each day on the trail, so I think from now on, I’ll go with 600g per day. I have reserves if you see what I mean and it’s not over 4 to 8 days of hiking that I’m going to develop health problems if I don’t eat enough calories per day. On a long thru-hike I would do differently of course.cold-soak vs warm foodWhen I have to carry food on my back, I prefer to take less weight so I don’t take a stove or cooking utensils. I only take food that I can cold-soak in water (dry mashed potatoes, couscous or ramen). To prepare it, I have a used ice-cream container with a screwed lid. Just put the food, add water, shake well and let it soak for half an hour.If I’m on a canoe or a motorcycle, then things are different, I take my little gas stove and I enjoy warm food (mostly pasta and ramen).",

        "author": "Ldom",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We all know the Amazon marketplace and its features. It’s a fantastic machine for selling products online, probably the best in the world.One-click shopping, wish lists, save for later, the infinite selection of products and vendors, the best prices for most products, etc. With Prime you get all of this, plus free shipping on almost every item.This is partially the reason why I cancelled my Prime subscription and why I’m not buying anymore from Amazon.By not buying anymore from them, I buy a lot less stuff that I don’t really need.Then, I’m trying to buy less from online sources. Buying online is great and convenient, but it’s not really good for the planet to have all these small packets shipped in all directions. It’s also not good for the local shops.Another reason is the dominant position of Amazon over online shopping. Having such a big player killing all the competition is never good in the long run for consumers. There are already a lot of products that are difficult to find outside of Amazon.Finally there’s the appalling lack of social responsibility of the company. From under-paying their employees, treating them like shit in fulfilment centres, uber-izing the delivery process or even organising this ridiculous global auction for HQ2. Why would you want to participate to this? If you want to know what social responsibility is, just look at what Patagonia does.",

        "title": "How to use a CI (CodeShip) to deploy a theme that won't build on Github pages",
        "author": "Ldom",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Github pages is a nice and free way to host a web site with static pages. It also supports Jekyll themes, which is great when you want to make things easier to edit and post.Github pages has a bunch of themes ready to be used and they also support any Jekyll theme hosted on a public repository on github.com. You just have to use remote_theme instead of theme in the __config.yml file.However, sometimes the theme that you have chosen builds without errors locally but doesn’t build when Github tries to do it. And then the error message is everything but helpful.Locally you get this:$ bundle exec jekyll doctor --config _config.ymlConfiguration file: _config.yml  Your test results are in. Everything looks fine.And when Github builds it, you get this:The page build failed for the master branch with the following error:Page build failed. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/troubleshooting-github-pages-builds.As you can see Page build failed. is not very useful. After hours trying to find the potential errors that they mention in the troubleshooting page, I gave up and went for a different solution.The solution is to use a second repository (in my case: ldom-src) to host the source files with the theme. These are the files you were putting on the original repository for the github pages (in my case: ldom). Then setup a CI server (Continuous Integration) to build the static files every time you push to the -src repository and push the static file to the github pages repository.Of course, you can put together the CI server yourself, using Jenkins for example, but it’s easier when you don’t have to manage a server for that. CodeShip is a CI service (I have no affiliation with them) that offers a free account limited to 100 builds per month (which is plenty for a personal site that you’ll update 30 times max per month).Here is how you set it up and the scripts to use:  Go to https://codeship.com  Sign up for the free tier.  Create a new project.In the Setup Commands tab, select “I want to create my own custom commands” and use:12bundle installbundle exec jekyll build --config _config.ymlIn the Setup Commands text area, use:123456789101112REMOTE_REPOSITORY=${REMOTE_REPOSITORY:?'You need to configure the REMOTE_REPOSITORY environment variable!'}REMOTE_BRANCH=${REMOTE_BRANCH:?'You need to configure the REMOTE_BRANCH environment variable!'}set -egit config --global user.email \"&lt;your email&gt;\"git config --global user.name \"&lt;your name&gt; (codeship)\"git clone ${REMOTE_REPOSITORY} _tmp -b ${REMOTE_BRANCH}cp -R _site/* _tmp/cd _tmpgit add .git statusgit commit -m \"new build\"git push origin masterIn the Environment tab, create 2 environment variables (to be used in the script above):  REMOTE_REPOSITORY: put the address of the destination repository, the one for the static Github pages, eg. git@github.com:ldom/ldom.git  REMOTE_BRANCH: put master  The last step is to configure CodeShip and Github to allow the deploy script to push (write) to the destination repository.This is described on this page: https://documentation.codeship.com/basic/builds-and-configuration/access-to-other-repositories/#sts=The%20Machine%20User%20SolutionI recommend using the “Machine User” solution. It involves:  creating a new github.com user and  give it access to the destination repository (by inviting it as a collaborator in the destination repository),  then you have to remove the key from the Deploy section under the destination repository (not your user settings, but the repository settings).  At last, you need to put that key (that has to be copied from General tab of the Project Settings in CodeShip) as a new key on the “Machine User” github account. (Note that if you don’t remove it first from the Deploy settings of the destination repository, you won’t be able to add that key to the “Machine User” keys).Once all of this is done, you’ll enjoy a full automated (and free) system where you just have to push to the -src repository for everything to be built and deployed to Github pages!",
