I've had 14 bikes over the years. 

Currently, I ride the good old BMW R850R that I bought new in 1996 and a delightful 2019 Husqvarna 701 Enduro. Unless it snows or it's really really cold, I go to work with them every day.

A failed project: <a href='/motorcycling/leggero/'>my Walt Siegl Leggero</a>

I'm not a big fan of riding on the road. For me, motorcycling is either a sport or an adventure (or the fastest way to move inside a city). I have done all kinds of road racing, enduro, moto-cross. Here are <a href='/motorcycling/vrac/'>random photos from the past</a> and my current bikes:
