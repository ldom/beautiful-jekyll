I learned flying in a Tecnam P2002 with the late (and great) Yves Perdrix. The P2002 is a pleasant alu 2-seater with a low wing and a 100-hp Rotax engine. At the Pleurtuit aero-club, I also flew in a bunch of Robin's.

After I moved to Canada, I started flying with Cessnas. I did one flight on the 150 and decided it was too cramped, so I moved to 172s....

I also spent some quality time with a Piper Supercub.

Then I jumped on the occasion to fly on a Cirrus SR20, that I shared with 5 other pilots until early 2019.
