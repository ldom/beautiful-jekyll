Who knows what went inside my head, a few years ago I decided to transform my Ducati SS900ie into a Walt Siegl Leggero. I contacted Walt who sold me a frame, tank and a bunch of parts and sent me on my way...

I had a lot of fun re-building it but it never really worked. So I had to part with it. A lot of fun, but I'll never do it again!
