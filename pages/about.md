Hi, I'm Laurent. I'm French and Canadian. 

I like to <a href='/hiking/'>hike</a>, <a href='/flying/'>fly</a> and ride my MTB or my <a href='/motorcycling/'>motorcycles</a>.

I'm also a <a href='/work/'>software engineer</a> so it's safe to say I'm a technophile. I excel at buying camping gear that my wife and sons say I won't use, but that's not true.

Various places I can be found online:

- <a href='https://twitter.com/ldom'>Twitter</a>
- <a href='https://instagram.com/ldom'>Instagram</a> (private, for friends and family)
- <a href='https://instagram.com/ldom17'>Instagram</a> (public)

Here are my glorious LighterPack lists:
- <a href='https://lighterpack.com/r/902jmo'>lightest setup, stove-less with a base weight of less than 4kg, yay!</a>
- <a href='https://lighterpack.com/r/fme9dx'>full list</a>

<small>This site is using Github static pages with the great <a href="https://github.com/Phlow/simplicit">Simplicity theme</a> by <a href="https://moritz.sauer.io/">Moritz "Mo" Sauer</a>, that I modified a little bit.</small>
